## Ingredients
 - Artichokes
 - Olive oil
 
## Directions
 1. Chop off about half of the artichoke stem.
 - Chop a small amount off the top so the artichoke can stand on itself when it's steamed.
 - Chop the artichoke in half
 - Steam them until you can stick a fork into the meat without any resistance
 - Remove them and carve out the purple shit with a spoon. Careful though, it's spiky and you'll probably poke yourself.
 - Pour a bit of olive oil into a small bowl and take a basting brush and baste oil onto part of the artichoke you just carved on (don't bother basting the leaves). 
 	- Make sure to get inside of the crater
 - Grill over medium heat for 5 minutes or until they look good enough to your liking.
