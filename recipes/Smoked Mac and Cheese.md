Grabbed this recipe from [Suburb Slicker BBQ](http://suburbslickerbbq.blogspot.com/2012/02/smoked-bacon-mac-cheese.html) and modified it a bit by using no butter or cooking spray, and substituting bacon for brocolli.

I prefer to smoke it over a mix of apple and cherry wood as I've found that tastes the best, but you can obviously substitude that for whatever wood you prefer.

## Serves
6 - 8

## Ingredients
 - 16 oz large elbow macaroni, cooked
 - 2 cups sharp cheddar cheese, shredded
 - 2 cups mexican blend (cheddar/colby) cheese, shredded
 	- Can also substitute this for 2 cups of gouda.
 - 5 oz parmsean cheese, shredded
 - 8 oz cream cheese, cubed
 - 1 pint heavy whipping cream
 - 1 cup milk
 - 1 tbs salt
 - 2 tbs pepper
 - 1 cup crushed corn flakes
 - 1 cup bread crumbs
 - 1lb bag of chopped brocolli florets
 - Foil container large enough to hold all of this.
 - `(optional)` 6 slices of smoked bacon, cut in 1″ pieces 
 
## Directions
 1. Prepare elbow macaroni according to package instructions.
 	- Highly recommend putting a few pinches of kosher salt in with the macaroni as it cooks. 
 - Mix elbow macaroni, bacon `(optional)`, cheddar cheese, mexican blend cheese, parmesean cheese and cream cheese together.
 - Mix heavy cream, milk, salt and pepper together.
 - Add milk mixture to macaroni mix and blend together.
 - Pour Mac n Cheese into cooking container.
 - Combine crushed corn flakes and bread crumbs together.
 - Pour Mac n Cheese into container.
 - Spread bread crumb mixture over top of Mac n Cheese to cover.
 - Place pats of butter on top of crumb mixture.
 - Smoke at 225°F for one hour. 
 	- If you don't have a smoker you could in an oven at the same temp and length, it just won't have that smokey goodness.
