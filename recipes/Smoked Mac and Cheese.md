Grabbed this recipe from [Suburb Slicker BBQ](http://suburbslickerbbq.blogspot.com/2012/02/smoked-bacon-mac-cheese.html) and modified it a bit by using no butter or cooking spray, and substituting bacon for brocolli.

It's incredibly heavy and filling, so if you make this, either make it for a lot of people or expect to have leftovers for a couple days.

## Serves
8 - 10

## Ingredients
 - 16 oz large elbow macaroni, cooked
 - 2 cups sharp cheddar cheese, shredded
 - 2 cups mexican blend (cheddar/colby) cheese, shredded
 	- Can also substitute this for 2 cups of gouda.
 - 5 oz parmsean cheese, shredded
 - 8 oz cream cheese, cubed
 - 1 pint heavy whipping cream
 - 1 cup milk
 - 1 tbs salt
 - 2 tbs pepper
 - 1 cup crushed corn flakes
 - 1 cup bread crumbs
 - 1lb bag of chopped brocolli florets
 - Foil container large enough to hold all of this.
 
## Directions
 1. Prepare elbow macaroni according to package instructions.
 	- Highly recommend putting a few pinches of kosher salt in with the macaroni as it cooks. 
 - Thaw your brocolli. Doesn't need to be warm since it's going to get cooked, it just shouldn't be frozen.
 - Mix elbow macaroni, cheddar cheese, mexican blend cheese, parmesean cheese and cream cheese together.
 - Mix heavy cream, milk, salt and pepper together.
 - Add milk mixture to macaroni mix and blend together.
 - Add brocolli and blend together.
 - ***Optional:*** Sriracha or your favorite hot sauce. Add as much as you can handle, and blend it together.
 - Pour Mac n Cheese into cooking container.
 - Combine crushed corn flakes and bread crumbs together.
 - Pour Mac n Cheese into container.
 - Spread bread crumb mixture over top of Mac n Cheese to cover.
 - Place pats of butter on top of crumb mixture.
 
### Smoker
Smoking the mac and cheese gives it a really nice meaty taste that you aren't going to get from an oven. I made this for Thanksgiving 2012 and a friend, who doesn't eat bacon, was absolutely convinced that there was some in it because that's what I usually smoke in my smoker.

I prefer to smoke this over a mix of apple and cherry wood as I've found that tastes the best, but you can obviously substitude that for whatever wood you prefer.

Smoke it at 225°F for one hour, or until it looks like it looks in the picture &mdash; nice and brown.

### Oven
If you don't have a smoker, you can cook this in an oven just fine, it just won't have that meaty and smokey taste that really makes the dish. Simply cook it at 350°F for about an hour, or until it's nice and brown on top.
