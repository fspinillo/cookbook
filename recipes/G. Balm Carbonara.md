 - 1/4 lb chopped bacon
 - 1/2 cup dry white wine
 - 2 egg yolks
 - 1/2 cup boiling water from pasta
 - 1/2 - 1 cup shredded parmesan or romano or pecorino or combo - hard cheese

## Directions
 1. Cook noodles to al dente
 - Scramble 2 egg yolks in bowl. Add 1/2 cup of boiling water from noodles to scrambled eggs to temper.
 - Cook bacon and then drain excess fat. Do not overcook to crispy. 
 - Heat olive oil in same pan with bacon, add onion and garlic and cook until garlic is slightly brown. 
 - Add wine and continue to cook for a few minutes. 
 - Lower heat and add cooked/drained noodles. 
 - Stir in scrambled egg yolks/hot water. Mix well, coating all noodles.
 - Throw in cheese and mix well.
